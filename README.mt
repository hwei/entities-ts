Entities-ts
=======

This is a library for writing game logic code with Entity Component System and typescript.
Inspired by Unity ECS system.

It supports using ArrayBuffer for component data storage. Maybe this will improve the performance? I haven't tested ;)

It does NOT include any graphic or user input function. So you have to use it with some other HTML5 game engine.
